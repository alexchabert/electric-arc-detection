#File content

Complete file size is 68Mo. It is support data for the article "AC Series Arc-Fault Detection With A Transformer Neural
Network" \cite{}. It allows the detail screening of the deep learning model results.

It contains the normalized current, the ground truth label and the predicted arc fault probabilities. This file contains around 1 million points per array: normalized arc current, label signal, predicted probability signal.
The arc current is a subsampled version of the Zenodo database:

The 21 arrays, corresponding to the 21 experiments, are concatenated into one single array.
