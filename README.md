#File content

Complete file size is 68Mo. It is support data for the article \cite{}.

It contains the normalized current, the ground truth label and the predicted arc fault probabilities. This file contains around 1 million points per array: normalized arc current, label signal, predicted probability signal.
The arc current is a subsampled version of the Zenodo database:
